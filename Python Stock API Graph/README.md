# Suraj and Ethan's MI250 Final Project

## Getting started

This Project will take a Stock name as an input and how many months ago you invested the stock into account.
Then it will show two graphs : One of the price of the stock vs time and another showing the volume of stock sold vs time

## Installation Requirements

```
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```
